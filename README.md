# Introducing i.mLearning: 

[Configuration Files](./src/config/readme.md)

Install using npm:

```bash
npm i i.mlearning
```

**Key Points to Consider:**

- **Token**: At the core of everything is the `Token` class. Every piece of data in your system starts as a token.
- **DataEntity**: This is a generalized class that represents broader categories or types of data (like languages, topics, etc.). It's built upon the foundational concept of a token.
- **Language (and other similar classes)**: These are specific classes that provide further granularity and specificity, built upon the generalized `DataEntity` concept.

**i.mLearning** concepts initially by identifying classes, but at the core, it's all about tokens.

# mLearning **Abstracting Pieces of Grain**

Let's break down how your site structure relates to tokens and how users interact with them at varying granularities.

### 1. **Highest Level: Categories/Themes**:

At the **top-most level**, you have distinct categories or themes such as Wildlife, Geography, Nature, and Economics. These can be considered as broad categories that group related tokens together.

### 2. **Mid-level: Subcategories/Topics**

Within each category, you have more specific topics: For Wildlife, you have Biology and within that, specific animals. For Geography, you have Cities and specific places.

### 3. **Granular Level: Individual Tokens**

At the most granular level, you have the individual tokens. These could be individual animals (Sharks, Lions), specific cities (Paris, Germany), or economic terms (Finance).

**How does this relate to machine learning and user interaction?**

1. **Data Input and Representation**: When feeding data into machine learning algorithms, granularity matters. For instance, if you're training a model to recognize animals, your input might be pictures labeled with the most granular tokens, e.g., "Shark," "Lion," etc. The tokens serve as distinct labels or classes for the model.
2. **User Interaction**: When a user interacts with your platform, they're navigating through a hierarchy of tokens. They might start at a high-level category (e.g., Wildlife), then drill down into a more specific topic (e.g., Biology), and finally arrive at a particular token (e.g., Sharks). The user's path gives insights into their interests and preferences, which can be valuable data.
3. **Personalization and Recommendation**: Based on a user's interaction with tokens, machine learning models can recommend related tokens or topics. For instance, if a user frequently interacts with tokens related to marine life (Sharks, Whales), the system might recommend other related tokens or content about Oceans, Coral Reefs, etc.
4. **User Queries**: When a user searches on your platform, they use tokens (e.g., "Sharks"). The search algorithm breaks down the user's query into tokens and finds the most relevant content based on those tokens.
5. **Semantic Understanding**: At a more advanced level, by understanding the hierarchy and relationships between tokens (Sharks are related to Biology, which is a part of Wildlife), machine learning models can better understand the semantic meaning and context. This is useful for tasks like semantic search or content summarization.

In essence, **tokens serve as the foundational units of information.** While machine learning models might work at the granular token level, users interact with a more structured and hierarchical representation of these tokens, moving from broad categories to specific details. **i.mLearning** acts as a bridge, facilitating this interaction and possibly using machine learning to enhance the user experience based on their interaction with tokens.

Defining categories and classes is crucial because they set the foundation for your system's organization. The categories and classes act as a blueprint that guides the development process, enabling you to handle data and functionalities systematically.

1. **Determine Categories:**
Categories act as the primary dividers of your data or functionality. They are the highest level of abstraction. Using your example:

**Main Categories:** Wildlife, Geography, Nature, Economics.
For each category, you'll have a set of subcategories or themes. 
For instance, under "Wildlife," you might have "Biology," "Mammals," and "Birds."

2. **Define Classes Within Categories:**
Each category and subcategory will have classes associated with it. Classes here represent the actual data structure or entity, defining properties and methods associated with that entity.

For example, within the **"Wildlife -> Mammals"** subcategory:

### Classes:

Lion (with properties like habitat, diet, lifespan, etc.)
Elephant
Whale

For each class, you can also define specific attributes or methods. For instance, the "Lion" class might have methods like "hunt()" or attributes like "average lifespan."

3. **Determine Hierarchical Structure:**It's crucial to decide the hierarchy or relationship between categories, subcategories, and classes.
    **For example:**
    A "Lion" belongs to the "Mammals" subcategory.
    "Mammals" belong to the "Wildlife" category.

4. **Data Modeling:**
For efficient data management and access:

**Create data models for each class.** These models will represent how data for each entity (like Lion, Elephant, etc.) is stored, retrieved, or manipulated.

**Determine relationships between these models**. For instance, if you have a "Habitat" class, the "Lion" class might have a relationship with it.

* A brief description of each category and class.
  * The properties and methods associated with each class.
    * The relationships between classes.

In your tokenized system, every piece of information, whether it's a broad category or a specific detail, is represented by a token. The power of this approach is that it reduces everything to a standardized, consistent unit (i.e., a token). 

The idea is to create a universal representation, a **"master token"** if you will, for each unique concept or entity like "lion." This master token serves as the canonical reference for that concept.

When you **tokenize concepts**, you gain several advantages:

1. **Language Agnosticism**: By tying every language's word for "lion" to a single token, you abstract away the language-specific details. Whether it's "lion" in English, "león" in Spanish, "lion" in French, or "लायन" in Hindi, they all refer back to the same master token.
2. **Efficiency**: You avoid redundancy. Instead of storing and managing multiple instances or definitions of lions for each language, you have one canonical representation. This makes your system leaner and faster.
3. **Consistency**: Since every language representation points back to the same token, there's a uniform understanding of the concept across the system. If you update information related to the lion token, it's reflected universally.
4. **Flexibility**: In future, if you want to add more details or attributes to the "lion" (like its habitat, behavior, etc.), you can simply enhance the master token. This automatically updates the understanding of "lion" across all languages.
5. **Interoperability**: Tokens can easily be used in various

# Tokens

### Handeling**Overlap and Intersection**: 
Some topics or entities might belong to multiple categories or subcategories. A "Dolphin," for example, could be under "Marine Life" and also under "Mammals." You might need mechanisms to handle such overlaps. Tags, for instance, can be a useful tool in such scenarios.

Here’s the system conceptualize:

1. **Modular Tokens**: Think of each piece of information or data as a module or token. Just as in a synthesizer, where each module performs a specific function (e.g., an oscillator, filter, or envelope generator), each token in your system encapsulates a specific piece of knowledge or a data entity.
2. **Inputs and Outputs**: Each token has specific inputs and outputs that determine how it can connect with other tokens. This is analogous to how modules in a synthesizer have CV (Control Voltage) inputs and outputs. The connections (or references) between tokens can be dynamic, allowing for a versatile and evolving knowledge web.
3. **No Strict Hierarchy**: Instead of a top-down hierarchical structure, you'd have a networked structure. Tokens connect to one another based on relevance, context, and the flow of information. This allows for flexibility and adaptability.
4. **Dynamic Interconnections**: Just as you can patch different modules together in a synthesizer to create new sounds, users can dynamically interconnect different tokens based on their needs. This might allow users to explore knowledge pathways that are non-linear and more organic.
5. **Feedback Loops**: In modular synthesizers, feedback loops can be created by routing the output of a module back into its input or another module's input. Similarly, in your system, tokens can reference back to themselves or other tokens, creating rich, recursive knowledge pathways.
6. **User Interface**: The user interface is critical. Consider a graphical UI that visually represents tokens and their interconnections, allowing users to "patch" them together intuitively, exploring and manipulating the flow of information.
7. **Expandability**: Just as you can add new modules to a modular synthesizer, your system can be designed to allow for the introduction of new tokens over time, expanding its knowledge base.
8. **Tags and Metadata**: To aid in the discoverability and interconnectivity of tokens, consider equipping each token with tags or metadata. This can help in determining how tokens might connect or relate to one another.

This modular system achieves:
- **Flexibility**: The system can evolve, adapt, and reconfigure based on the changing landscape of information or user needs.
- **Interactivity**: Users have an active role in shaping their knowledge journey, creating pathways that are most relevant to them.
- **Depth and Breadth**: The networked structure allows users to dive deep into specific topics or take a broader view, depending on how they connect the tokens.
- **Personalization**: With machine learning, the system could suggest potential token interconnections based on user behavior, making their experience more personalized and intuitive.
